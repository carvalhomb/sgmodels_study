Comparing to the previous model I'd say this one has the exact opposite problem: too large boundaries","ATMSG did not change perception. ATMSG is very descriptive. ATMSG can be limiting by offering a very long list.","ATMSGNoChangePerception, ATMSGTooDescriptive, ATMSGIsLimiting","ATMSGTooDetailed"
"ONL103","ATMSG-Suggestion","Totally not. I will take a look at it further in these days: I recognized a lot of taxonomies and translated some of them (language barrier worked as a creativity fosterer in my humble opinion)","No suggestions for ATMSG; it fills its objective","ATMSGFillsObjective",
"ONL103","Comment",,,,
"ONL103","Comparison01-EasierUnderstand","LM-GM: the student is not blocked by the grat number of tables containing different taxonomies. Defining a direct relation between LM and GM is harder but it pays off","LMGM is easier to understand because user is not blocked by a large number of options. Harder and more useful to establish direct relationship between LM and GM","LMGMMoreFlexible, LMGMHelpful","LMGMInvitesMoreThinking, LMGMHelpful"
"ONL103","Comparison02-EasierApply","ATMSG. More terms, larger boundaries: less term-related barriers","ATMSG is easier to apply because of larger taxonomy","ATMSGLargerTaxonomy","ATMSGBetterTaxonomy"
"ONL103","Comparison03-BetterUnderstanding","LM-GM forced me to think outside of my comfort zone: less terms + easier task = harder choices.  I liked ATMSG since it feels more precise and complete but I'd try again LM-GM ending up problably hating it","ATMSG is more precise and complete, LMGM is harder to find the right choice","AMTSGMoreComplete, LMGMHardToFill","ATMSGMoreDetailed"
"ONL103","LMGM-Perception","It forced me to described game patterns through not really strict categories: it had a positiv feedback since It broke my usual mental-flow forcing me (counter intuitivly) to be precise. Now I feel like my opinion about the game is more precise BUT less easy to change","LMGM forced participant to be precise, now shaped his view of the game into something that is not likely to change","LMGMPromotePrecision","LMGMHelpful"
"ONL103","LMGM-Suggestion","A learning mechanic is something well defined, a game mechanic is a big cauldron which contains habits, 3d expression, animation, HC interaction and cognitiv schemes: the only tip I feel confident about is the only related to my field. Distinguish between game 'plans' such as 'linguistic' 'chromatic' 'interactive' trying to define them (an easy job you'll say!) clearly.   For example: i found that most of the role playing part of the game examined took part into the person-items referrals of the game. So although the main avatar is represented his intra-game world perception passed through small linguistical parts of each game phase.

"ONL105","Comment","Models are both quite complex and this study cannot reduce their complexity, thus resulting to be very heavy to be completed. It was very hard to find motivation to complete the questionnaire, and I feel I was superficial in some parts just to end.","Both models are complex. Study is heavy.

"ONL105","Comparison03-BetterUnderstanding","ATMSG definitively. It clarified the fondamentals of the serious game, on the contrary LM-GM gives only some associations without defining a structure of the game.","ATMSG gives better understanding of the game, LMGM gives associations but without defining the game structure.
