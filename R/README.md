# R scripts

Use the RMarkdown script **Report.Rmd** to generate a report with the analysis of the data in the **clean-data** folder. 

To generate the report, you can use KnitR inside RStudio, or the Makefile provided in the root directory.

Please note that this script will not run directly in the Limesurvey exported data. The data needs to be cleaned up manually to conform to the structure described in **clean-data/README.md**.
